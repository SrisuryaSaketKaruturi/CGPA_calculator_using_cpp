## CGPA CALCULATOR


## Overview
This project is a simple yet functional CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) Calculator built using C++. It allows students to input their academic performance data semester-by-semester, including subject names, grades, and credit hours. The program calculates both semester-wise GPA and the final CGPA, and presents a detailed academic report.

## Introduction
In educational institutions, tracking a student's performance over time is critical for measuring academic growth, identifying areas of improvement, and making informed decisions about scholarships, placements, or further studies. Among the most widely used metrics for this are GPA (Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average).Calculating them semester-by-semester can become tedious, especially as course loads increase. This project addresses that problem by automating GPA and CGPA computation through a simple yet effective C++ application. It leverages basic data structures and control flow to provide a user-friendly experience, making it an ideal example of how programming can simplify real-world tasks for students and educators alike.

2.Input of Name and Number of semester.

    string student_name;
    cout<<"enter student name:";
    cin.ignore();
    getline(cin,student_name);


    int semester_num;
    cout<<"enter no.of semester:";
    cin>>semester_num;


3. Input and Storing number of subjects,subject name,grade and credit hours for each semster in a 2-D array.Calculation of the Semester GPA

       for(int i=0;i<semester_num;i++)
       {
           int semgradepoint=0;
           int semcredit=0;
           cout<<"Semester "<<(i+1)<<" :"<<endl;

           cout<<"enter no.of subjects:";
           cin>>sub_num[i];

           for(int j=0;j<sub_num[i];j++)
           {
               cout<<"enter subject "<<(j+1)<<" name:";
               cin.ignore();
               getline(cin,subject_name[i][j]);

               cout<<"Enter grade:";
               cin>>grade[i][j];

               cout<<"Enter credit hours:";
               cin>>credit_hours[i][j];

               gradepoint= (grade[i][j])*(credit_hours[i][j]);
               semgradepoint+=gradepoint;
               semcredit+=credit_hours[i][j];

           }
           sem_gpa[i]=(float)(semgradepoint)/(semcredit);
